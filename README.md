Hi reviewer ðŸ‘‹

I just wanted to use this space to thank you for considering my application and for reviewing this code. I really appreciate the time and effort!

Even though I am applying for a fullstack position, I consider myself way more of a frontend developer instead of a backend. That said, I tried to keep the backend as simple as possible.

In my previous role as a developer I've contributed sparringly to the backend in Node JS and a long time ago I used to do Ruby on Rails instead.

Lastly, I enjoyed a lot going through this exercise ðŸŽ‰. Regardless if I am chosen or not I had fun, so thank you again :)
